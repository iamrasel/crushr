## Download
Currently, only one option is available for you to download this app, and it's Github release. This release version was built using Github's workflow, then I manually published the apk file as a release.

You can also download the latest workflow build by Github. To do that, head over to the [Actions](https://github.com/iamrasel/crushr/actions) tab and then select the latest run from there. You must be signed in to Github to download any build from there.

There's another option to get this app- fork and build it. This project is very simple and pure, it doesn't need any additional setup. Just open it in Android Studio.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this project, I would suggest you to start from the [TODO](#todo) list first. Then you can do whatever comes up to your mind.

## Credits
As you can see, this is a fork of [this](https://github.com/tjmolinski/crushr) same titled project, which was abandoned back in 2015. I found this app on F-droid, used it and then decided to modify it to fulfill my needs. But then I thought, why not share it with others?
